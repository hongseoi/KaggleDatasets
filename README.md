With the entry into force of the Refugee Convention and the Refugee Protocol in 1992, South Korea has been obliged to protect refugees under the Convention since 1993.
However, the limits of the human rights of refugees cannot be properly expressed in Korea's Immigration Control Act, which has been repeatedly pointed out by the international community and civil society.
These discussions continued for over 10 years, and in 2012, a new refugee law was finally enacted. This refugee law is a refugee law as an independent human rights law and contains the following contents.

Conceptual definitions of 'refugees', 'refugee applicants', 'persons granted humanitarian status', etc.
Declaration of the principle of prohibition of forced repatriation without exception
Mandatory support for refugee application procedures, such as cooperation with related organizations, assistance with lawyers, and interpretation
Taking into account the special characteristics of refugees, the burden of proof and the degree of proof are eased
Establishment of Refugee Committee
Support for living expenses and employment until the end of the refugee status examination

This dataset contains information on the status of refugee applications from 2013 to 2022, after the new refugee law came into force.
