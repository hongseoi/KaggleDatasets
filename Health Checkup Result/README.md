In Korea, everyone is compulsorily required to join the National Health Insurance. The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), which manages national health insurance, provides basic health checkups to subscribers every year.

This dataset is the result of a random sampling of 1 million people per year from 2002 to 2021 among those who underwent basic health checkups provided by the NHIS.

Missing values are those that have not been selectively tested by individuals.

This dataset consists of a total of 19 csv files for each year, and each csv file contains only the health checkup results for that year. There are differences in the features of the dataset by year.

1. Difference in the number of columns
- There are features that have been excluded or added by year.

## Problems

### 데이터셋을 만들면서 발생한 문제들

- 한번에 19개의 csv 파일을 load 할 수 없음
    - 원래 for문으로 한번에 처리하려고 했는데, 오류가 나서 결국 하나하나 반복
- rename시 column 이름이 다른 문제
    - 2002년부터 20년까지 오랜 기간의 데이터이다보니 column name이 다른 경우가 존재. 직접 수정해주어야 했다.
- 2013년 파일의 unnamed 컬럼 2개
    - unique 수행시 NaN 또는 공백이었기에 제거하였다.
- 2019년 파일의 data load err
    - ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 34 fields in line 175683, saw 36 가 발생, 아래에서 해결 시도
