 With the entry into force of the Refugee Convention and the Refugee Protocol in 1992, South Korea has been obliged to protect refugees under the Convention since 1993. However, the limits of the human rights of refugees cannot be adequately expressed in Korea's Immigration Control Act, which the international community and civil society have repeatedly pointed out. These discussions continued for over 10 years, and in 2012, a new refugee law was finally enacted. This refugee law is a refugee law as an independent human rights law and contains the following contents.

* Conceptual definitions of 'refugees', 'refugee applicants', 'persons granted humanitarian status', etc.
* Declaration of the principle of prohibition of forced repatriation without exception
* Mandatory support for refugee application procedures, such as cooperation with related organizations, assistance with lawyers, and interpretation
* Taking into account the special characteristics of refugees, the burden of proof and the degree of proof are eased
* Establishment of Refugee Committee
* Support for living expenses and employment until the end of the refugee status examination

This dataset contains information on the status of refugee applications from 2013 to 2022, after the new refugee law came into force.

**In order to protect individual refugees' personal information and prevent identification, countries with less than 100 applications for refugee recognition are marked as Other.**
